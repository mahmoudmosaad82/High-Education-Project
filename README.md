# High-Education-Project
We are making a RESTful API by framework Node.js with Express.js , Our program is for University to save data of those who willing to continue Masters and PHD Degrees.
A student management system for higher education registry is a software system designed to help manage student information, enrollment, academic records, and other administrative functions. The system should be able to store data in a local database and provide access to the data at any time. The system should also include the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions for student records.

Key features of the system  include:

Student data management: The system should be able to store and manage data on students, including personal information, academic records, and enrollment details.

Enrollment management: The system should allow administrators to manage student enrollment, including course registration and scheduling.

Academic records management: The system should enable administrators to manage student academic records, including grades, transcripts, and degree requirements(FUTURE USE).

User management: The system should provide role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive student information.

To wrap up, the student management system should be designed to streamline administrative processes, improve data accuracy and accessibility, and support decision-making based on data analysis.
