##description of controller file
This is a Node.js module that exports several functions related to managing a list of students in a computer department. The module requires other modules, such as Joi and validation helpers.

The getAllstudents function returns all students in the computer_dep_students array. The getStudentById function finds and returns a student by the ID specified in the request parameters.

The addStudent function creates a new student object based on the data sent in the request body and adds it to the computer_dep_students array. The student object has properties such as student_name, student_dep, sudent_UniversityID, academic_year, degree, and subjects.

The editStudent function finds a student by ID and updates its student_name property with the data sent in the request body. It uses the validateStudentId helper function to validate the data before updating the object. However, the code for validation is commented out in the current implementation.

The deleteStudent function finds and removes a student from the computer_dep_students array by ID. It then returns the removed student object.

Overall, this module provides basic functionality for managing a list of students in a computer department, but it could be improved by adding more validation checks and error handling.
